	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Pizza Shop! We are a family-owned pizza restaurant located in the heart of Cape Coast. Our passion for pizza started over 20 years ago when we decided to bring our authentic Italian pizza recipe to the Ghana.

At Pizza Shop, we believe in using only the freshest ingredients to create our delicious pizzas. From our homemade tomato sauce to our hand-tossed dough, every pizza is made with care and attention to detail. We offer a wide variety of toppings to choose from, including classic options like pepperoni and mushrooms, as well as more unique options like goat cheese and arugula.

Our commitment to quality extends beyond our pizza ingredients. We strive to provide exceptional customer service and a warm, welcoming atmosphere in our restaurant. Whether you're dining in with us or ordering takeout, our goal is to make sure you have a fantastic experience from start to finish.
